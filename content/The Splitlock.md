The **Splitlock** is an artifact that played a major role during the [[Thousand Days' War|Thousand Days' War.]]

The Splitlock is an object of unknown size and shape that has accompanying keys that are used to unlock it. Modern rumors and historical musings from the [[Timeline of Atlaax|Age of War]] would tell you that to collect all these keys and unlock the Splitlock would mean unleashing power on the level of the [[Great Fusion|first Calamity.]] 

The artifact first appeared on the [[Riwera|western continent]] during the Thousand Days' War. A goal of mankind was to collect the artifact's keys from across the planet during their conquest, in order to unlock it and use its power for some unknown ends. The formation of the [[Pantheon Coalition]] during the War was primarily due to the threat the Splitlock posed—risking its activation meant risking the world itself.

Thus, after the Splitlock was taken at the end of the War, the Coalition sealed the artifact in an unknown location and spread its keys among participating states. In the modern Age, much superstition exists surrounding the Splitlock and its keys.

Various churches and hidden orders believe the artifact to be either a foul devil-weapon or a divine fragment of their gods, but the prevailing theory is that the device was developed on one of the [[Primeworld|primeworlds.]] Generally speaking, the artifact's exact origins are not known—even to the most knowledgable few in modern times.

The exact appearance and true nature of the Splitlock is a closely guarded secret across the [[The Meridian|Meridian]]—a safety measure enacted by the Pantheon Coalition. Only the highest-ranking members of the major world superpowers and orthodox churches know this information.
