**Prime Draconic** was the script of the ancient dragon races that ruled [[Atlaaxian System|Atlaaxian System]] in the **Pre-Fusion [[Timeline of Atlaax|Age.]]**

Prime Draconic is considered the oldest surviving language across the planet, dating back tens of thousands of years. The planet’s name, as well as the name of the moons and suns, have remained unchanged from their Prime Draconic origins.

Spoken Prime Draconic, similar to its modern counterpart, consists of gutteral consonants and frequent use of the “a” vowel sound. 

Prime Draconic has been ascribed a deep connection to magic across all cultures and practices, as it holds a deep connection to the planet itself. The verbal components of most well-documented spells, as well as their runic equivalents, consist of roughly 70% Prime Draconic vocabulary. This percentage differs by culture and even by individual magics, but almost all magic in the modern world takes or repurposes some part of this ancient tongue.
