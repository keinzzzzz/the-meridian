# Introduction
Prime Draconic is considered the oldest surviving language across the [[Atlaax|planet,]] dating back [[Pre-Fusion Age|tens of thousands of years]] to the time of [[Dragons|intelligent dragons]]. The planetâ€™s name, as well as the names of the [[Greatmoons|greatmoons]] and [[Twin Suns|suns,]] have remained unchanged from their Prime Draconic origins.

# Written Language & Applications
Scholars across the [[The Meridian|Meridian]] believe dragons may have utilized two different alphabets: a series of runes used for magical purposes, and a script used for common writing. This distinction was probably important to their culture, as Prime Draconic runes have magical properties inherent to their shapes to this day.

Prime Draconic has been ascribed a deep connection to magic across all cultures and practices, as it seems to command a connection to the planet itself. The verbal components of most well-documented spells, as well as their runic equivalents, consist of roughly 70% Prime Draconic vocabulary. This percentage differs by culture and even by individual magics, but almost all magics across the [[The Meridian|Meridian]] take or repurpose some part of this ancient tongue.

Spells involving written elements will most certainly take advantage of the language's magical properties.

# Spoken Language

Spoken Prime Draconic consists of sounds that may have been trivial for dragons to pronounce, but have proven difficult to pronounce for humanoids. The language makes frequent use of guttural consonants, extended double-vowels, and the z-sound "x" (like in "xylophone"). Many place-names across [[Atlaax]] are partially derived from this language. The following lists some prefixes, suffixes, and basic concepts' names within the language.
