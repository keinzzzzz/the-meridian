## Planet Atlaax
[[Atlaax]] (meaning "all as one" in [[Prime Draconic (Language)|Prime Draconic]]) is the name of the planet on which the [[The Meridian|Meridian]] resides and my various campaigns take place. 

## The Atlaaxian System
### Suns
The Atlaaxian system is a binary system possessing [[Twin Suns|two suns]], with the planet itself being in a circumbinary orbit around their center of mass (for your purposes, think of Tatooine from Star Wars).

The two stars are a red dwarf and white dwarf, respectively, that orbit about their center of mass every 0.11 of an Atlaaxian day (roughly every two and a half hours), meaning that the stars eclipse each-other regularly.

Atlaax itself is in an orbit much closer to its star than Earth, as dwarf stars are much cooler and thus the habitable zone is much closer. Still, the suns always appear very close together in the sky.

### The Greatmoons
The system also possess two notable planets, a [[Greatmoons|pair of gas giants]] named **Xurkaali**  ("shadow daughter" in Prime Draconic) and **Xalkaali** ("green daughter" in Prime Draconic). These planets orbit further from the suns than Atlaax, and have historically been incorrectly named as moons of the planet due to their prominence in the night sky. Thus, they became known as **greatmoons.**

The greatmoons appear slightly larger on average than [[Earth|Earth's]] Moon did at night, but are always changing size as Atlaax completes its orbit. At its closest approach, Xalkaali appears roughly the size of a tennis ball held at arm's length. At its furthest approach, it appears no different from planets in the Solar System do on Earth; like stars. 

Colloquially, their names are often shorted to "Xur" and "Xal," or they are simply called the "dark moon" and "green moon" respectively.

Note that Xurkaali is exceedingly difficult to spot, as it reflects almost no sunlight.

Atlaax has no actual moons.

## The Rings
The defining celestial aspect of the planet is, undoubtedly, its [[Rings of Atlaax|rings.]] Atlaax's rings are a vast, icy band of various hues that wrap the planet along the equator. 

At night, the rings are much brighter than the Moon is on Earth. Thus, truly dark nights can only be found at the poles, where the rings are a small arc on the horizon, or the equator, where the rings are a thin line. The rings from [[Kaiho Dynasty|Kaiho]], on the Southern pole:

The rings from [[Nova Point]], on the equator:

Additionally, the full rings are never visible all at once due to the planet's shadow cast on them. However, the shadow is smallest (and rings brightest) at dusk and dawn. The rings from [[Delta]], at dusk:

As night goes on, Atlaax's shadow passes across the rings, growing largest at the "midpoint" of night. The view from Delta, at that time:

For these reasons, timekeeping on the planet is remarkably easy at most points of latitude; one can use a shadowclock or simply look at the size of Atlaax's shadow on the rings to determine the rough time of night

# Seasons and Shadows
The planet has only four degrees of axial tilt compared Earth's 24, and therefore has extremely mild axial seasons. However, the planet is also in a far more elliptical (oval-shaped) orbit than Earth.

Because of this, seasons are experienced equally by both hemispheres, with global summers occurring at the closest points of the orbit, and global winters at the farthest point. 
# Cold at the Equator, Hot Elsewhere
Because of the rings' shadow on the planet, there are periods in the morning and evening all across the planet when the suns are obscured by the rings. The effect here is similar to window-tint in a car; the suns would still be visible, just dimmer. Although subtle, this daily blockage causes the planet's climate to be more extreme on average than Earth's.

Due to axial tilt and the rings being dead-on at the equator, there are also times of the year where the equatorial regions of the planet are bathed in a [[Evernight|constant night]] due to the rings blocking sunlight there. Thus, the equatorial regions on Atlaax are bitterly cold for most of the year, while the areas between the ringshadow and poles are warmed by sunlight reflected off the rings.
