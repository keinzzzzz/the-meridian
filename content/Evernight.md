**Evernight** regions are those within the span just north and south of [[Atlaaxian System|Atlaax's]] equator. Because the [[Rings of Atlaax|rings]] are almost completely edge-on at these regions, the dust and ice that forms them causes a complete blockage of sunlight and thus plunges those regions into complete darkness for various spans of the year. 

In [[Empire of Avalan|Avalan,]] the capital city [[Nova Point]] sits exactly at the point where evernight is constant throughout the year. As the [[The Meridian|Meridian]] only has one equatorial region, this is the only place not [[Shroud|shrouded]] that has to deal with evernight.

Historically, the effects of evernight have strongly influenced the people and cultures that rise around the equator. People from evernight regions, regardless of race, often appear sickly and pale and have strong night-vision. In special cases, people have even developed limited forms of *darkvision* despite not belonging to a race genetically predisposed to that trait.

Such people have an acute sensitivity to sunlight. Notably, across the many Avalanian campaigns in [[Ryu-ike|the southern continent,]] soldiers raised in evernight were observed wearing shaded visors during daylight battles. In fact, it is believed that Avalanian military strategy accounts for this sun-blindness, for nighttime was the most common time for assaults to occur across all Avalanian campaigns.
