The **Three Seers** are three notable people known throughout the [[The Meridian|Meridian.]] Seers are born with special [[Souleyes|eyes]] that grant them the ability to see souls and even receive visions of the future. 

The Seers are the main pillar of [[Helixism|Helixism,]] which claims them to be prophets that guide the [[The Meridian|Meridian]] through the [[Ages|Ages,]] preventing the world from succumbing to [[Calamity|Calamity.]]

For unknown reasons, only three Seers can live at the same time; when one Seer dies, the next person born on the [[The Meridian|Meridian]] will be take up the title. Thus, the title of Seer moves from person to person, and not all Seers are historically notable. However, given their unique affinity for magic, many Seers have been known to live many times their species' average lifespan.
