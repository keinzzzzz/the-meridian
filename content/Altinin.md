**Altinin** (meaning “The Dragon’s Claws” in [[Prime Draconic (Language)|Prime Draconic]]), the northern continent of the [[The Meridian|Meridian,]] is a harsh land of searing heat and frigid cold. To the far north, steppelands spread about angular land masses between deserts and mesas, with mountainous sandstorms blasting their way through oceans of yellowing grasslands. Marauders ride giant arthropods across the dunes, picking off drifters as they make their way between oases. Golden palaces dedicated to the suns tower over multilayered cities of sandstone, as thousands of colorful people walk the streets. In the shadow of gargantuan mountains, horrific beasts prowl in the rippling prairie grass. In the south-central tropics, pirate galleons and tribal longboats alike glide between shattered archipelagos. Returning to the mainland, thick old-growth taigas stretch south, the quiet hamlets within living in fear of the mutated beasts that roam them. Near the equator, frigid wind slices across a shadowy land bathed in [[Evernight|evernight,]] where walled cities of metal cling to the surface of blue glaciers. Altinin, also known as the Northern Continent or the Land Without Rain, is an unforgiving place where water is gold and trust is everything.
