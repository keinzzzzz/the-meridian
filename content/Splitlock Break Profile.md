## Tone

The mood of your campaign. How does it FEEL to play in this campaign

- I want my campaign to feel adventurous and somewhat lighthearted, but with dark moments (cosmic horrors❤) and emotional moments littered throughout to keep it feeling grounded (a vibe like Avatar TLA). I also want to inspire a sense of scale and grandness; I want my players to get the feeling their characters are small—but significant—actors on a humongous stage.
    
- Maybe the tone will shift from adventurous—>serious as the campaign goes on and the stakes rise (Fullmetal Alchemist does this).
    

## Concept

- This story follows a party of adventurers who are trying to stop an ancient evil order from using the Splitlock for their own goals.

## Setting

- This story takes place on the Meridian, a shattered region where humans are not the dominant species. Instead, humankind makes up the slave class in most societies and are almost universally despised. This is because of a great war waged by humankind to conquer the planet, all in an attempt to unlock the divine artifact named the Splitlock. With the Splitlock sealed and the human population pruned to acceptable levels, a tense Age of Peace has held for almost 600 years. Today, in the year 598, the land boils with tension: fears of fresh conflict between world superpowers, the orthodox churches, and ancient orders brew among the common people.

## Conflict

- An ancient continental order has stolen the Splitlock from its protectors, but they can't activate it without its keys, which have long been destroyed. The order has found a way to reverse-engineer these keys, but this mysterious process will take time. If they succeed, they will be able to freely reshape the world in their image, ushering in a new Age.

## Introduction

Long ago, the world was composed of many separate, isolated worlds. Each of these worlds held their own gods, their own technologies, and their own magic. Then, an event known as the [[Great Fusion]] ended this segregation, violently smashing every world together into a new, single planet named [[Atlaaxian System|Atlaax.]] The gods’ battle darkened the skies, and as moons collided and stars fell, the armies of a thousand nations clashed over new unforgiving lands. Thus, the part of the world least ravaged—a band of two continents and six seas—became known as [[The Meridian|the Meridian.]]

Ten thousand years elapsed, divided into [[Timeline of Atlaax|Ages:]] the first ruled by chaos, the second by darkness, the third by gold, the fourth by war, and the fifth and current by peace. In this time, the humanoids of Atlaax were shaped through conflict, and evolved into the many varied cultures across the Meridian's two continents, [[Altinin]] and [[Ryu-ike|Ryu-Ike.]]During the **Age of War**, the world came under threat by **humankind,** who used rediscovered knowledge from their [[Primeworld|origin world,]] **[[Earth|Earth,]]** to siege the land. This incredible human effort was fueled by a need to activate a certain artifact named the **Splitlock.**

The [[Splitlock|Splitlock]], "the door with a thousand keys," was heralded to hold the power to hold back the stars, to level continents, to summon history, and to shift fate itself. Humanity planned to dominate the land with its power, but before its keys could be gathered, they became engaged in the planet-wide [[Thousand Days' War]] after their plot was revealed by the [[Three Seers|Three Seers.]] The nations of the Meridian, united under the [[Pantheon Coalition|Pantheon Coalition,]] mobilized to stop humankind before the god-artifact was activated. A thousand cultures, once divided, banded together for the first and final time to seize the Splitlock and crush the human forces. The Splitlock was sealed by the Pantheon Coalition in an unknown location, and the honor of destroying its many keys was divided amongst the war's participants across the Meridian.

Almost six hundred years later, the Splitlock has gone missing, and the land has been thrown into chaos. The once peaceful land of Altinin, still bleeding from the wounds of the old war, roils with a tension that threatens to devour it once and for all. An ancient order that has been pulling the strings of fate for millennia has finally revealed itself, and only the knowledgeable few can hope to stand in the way of their schemes. The clock is ticking: will you stop this Hidden Order before they activate the Splitlock, or try to seize the power it protects for yourself?
