Gill Rronkum: They took your apprentice.
Shiitake Mazda: They murdered your master.
Agani Icewalker: They want to free your ancestor, and then kill him.
Citadel: Your brothers serve them.
Sean Kelly: They had a hand in your parents death, and now your remaining family are their pawns.

And now, they've taken the Splitlock.

I know of your exploitation by the Dragon of Imagination. "Akhil's" true name is Akhilax, there are no Keybearers, and every part of your journey went exactly according to his plan. He serves the Hidden Order, and they have begun to move.

I can help you take them down.

Before I tell you more, we must meet in person. Find me in Grandport, on the fifth of Janus at 2:10 PM beneath the stage of the First kaiid's address. We will talk.
