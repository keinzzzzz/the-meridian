The **Greatmoons,** Xurkaali ("shadow daughter" in [[Prime Draconic (Language)|Prime Draconic]]) and Xalkaali ("green daughter" in [[Prime Draconic (Language)|Prime Draconic]]), are a pair of gas supergiants in the [[Atlaaxian System]] that orbit in unstable paths around the [[Twin Suns|suns]] beyond the orbit of [[Atlaax|Atlaax.]]

The greatmoons appear slightly larger on average than [[Earth|Earth's]] Moon did at night, but are always changing size as Atlaax completes its orbit. At its closest approach, Xalkaali appears roughly the size of a tennis ball held at arm's length. At its furthest approach, it appears no different from planets in the Solar System do on Earth; like stars. 

Scholars of the [[The Meridian|Meridian]] believe the greatmoons to have magical properties. Periodically, Xur and Xal come into [[Convergence|alignment]] with Atlaax, creating gravitational and magical disturbances across the land.
