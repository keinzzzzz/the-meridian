Welcome to the world of the Meridian. This website contains any and all information pertinent to my D&D campaign(s), including (but not limited to) character backstories, lore tidbits, campaign profiles, and session recaps.

Feel free to read anything or nothing, but I like to reward my dawgs who read (OR contribute to!) my collection of horseshit.
