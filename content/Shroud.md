The **Shroud** is a thick, writhing mass of shadow that engulfs [[Atlaaxian System]] everywhere except for the [[The Meridian|Meridian]], where it seemingly is unable to penetrate.

Little is known about the nature of the magic that facilitates the Shroud, and nearly all attempts to study it or explore the shadowed regions end in tragedy. Much superstition, regardless of culture, exists regarding the strange darkness. Sailors whisper legends of entire fleets devoured by shadows, of ghost ships emerging with their crews missing, or of terrible beasts diving in and out of the Shroud. 

 It is believed, based on tectonics, that there may be landmasses within the shadowy regions that remain unexplored, but no sane man would dare venture to find them. It is not known if any people, flora, or fauna live within the Shroud, or if life can even survive there at all.

Publicized experiments conducted by [[Kingdom of Saint Elith|Elithi]] researchers have revealed the effects of the Shroud on people. The researchers tested the effects of Shroud exposure on criminals of various races who were sentenced to execution. In the experiment, one hundred percent of subjects exposed for even a few seconds suffered madness beyond healing (surgical or magical). This madness was characterized by manic psychosis and an intense desire to harm others or themselves. Three of every four subjects whispered similar incoherent ravings in an unknown language. 

The experiment is now famous among sciographers (those who study the Shroud), as publicization of the findings occurred only after the experiment lead, Lina Vestialis, killed her husband, her three children, and herself following her return to the mainland. Vestialis had no previous mental afflictions, and was a well-respected scholar across the kingdom. A short letter, written in neat handwriting, was found clutched in Vestialis’ fist:

"ALL YE WHO REGARD MY MESSAGE, 
DESPAIR, FOR THE LAND BURSTS WITH THOSE BEYOND DEATH. 
DESPAIR, FOR THE HEAVENS ARE SILENT. 
DESPAIR—FOR OUR KIND ARE NO LONGER WELCOME THERE.” 

The Shroud has seemingly existed since end of first [[Timeline of Atlaax|Age,]] with its formation being attributed to the [[Calamity]] of that ended it.
