# Timeline
### Delta Arc
On the 15th of Nova, a ritual circle burst with power. Guided by Akhilax, Dragon of Imagination, five souls were teleported to an abandoned temple buried in the Crystal Barrens, 150 miles west of Delta in the [[Quarantine Nation of Atra]]. Guided by their strange Draconic patron “Akhil,” who convinced them they should pursue the Splitlock and its keys, the five set out together.

On the 17th of Nova, five vagabonds entered the ruins of the ancient city Kai’ba, and made contact with its humanoid inhabitants—the Kraul tribe. In return for filling their water stores, the five vagabonds were to travel with the tribe’s greatest warrior guide. Shortly after leaving the ruins, the vagabonds killed the guide and stole his mutilated corpse.

On the 19th of Nova, five weary travelers were forced into a cave by a terrible crystal sandstorm that could slice metal into ribbons. After baiting the cave’s wolflike inhabitants with the Kraul guide’s rotted carcass, the travelers slaughtered the beasts, before waiting out the storm. 

On the 21st of Nova, five exhausted travelers coated in blood and sand approached Delta, capital city of Atra. After slaying their way through the desert’s many horrors, which included a terrible burrowing scorpion, they had finally arrived. In pursuit of another key, the five entered the city. Just before them, a sickly young man had entered the city as well.

Hearing of a strange sermon scheduled for the next day, the five travelers went seeking a “Keybearer” by the will of their dream guide. Eventually reaching the home hamlet of a member of their cohort, the five discovered the Keybearer had just passed by. Before continuing, the five travelers rested their weary bodies.

On the 22nd of Nova, Vell, the Living Plague, unleashed a maddening hunger upon the city of Delta. Under special orders, the five travelers took advantage of the chaos to free a strange priestess from a giant crystal. Narrowly escaping Vell with the unconscious woman, the five fled the plague-ridden city. 

On the 23rd of Nova, the five travelers fought their way inside a derelict human tower, eventually triumphing against its guardian—a horrifying creature with the power to steal souls for power. Then, the five travelers sealed a demigod in a key. With their chaperone satisfied, the five entered the desert, fleeing from both the plague in Delta and the forces of a foreign government come to lay siege to it.

### Grandport Gauntlet Arc

On the 10th of Decka, five blood-soaked travelers crossed the border of the [[Fleet Alliance of Latreia]] and entered an oasis. After freeing the goblin Medora from a trap and reuniting her with her guardian, Cataclysm, the seven travelers entered the Northern Trade Capital known as [[Grandport]] to enter its yearly bloodsport together—all to meet another "Keybearer." 

Under orders from their chaperone to seek help with preparations for the Gauntlet, the five travelers and their two companions paid a visit to 200 Tempest Street. After striking a deal to split their potential earnings with her, the seven travelers gained lodging and training under Edina Redd, a deserter of the [[High Empire of Avalan|High Empire of Avalan]] with a fearsome reputation.

On the 11th of Decka, five challengers registered themselves as the Marooned Five, all to make contact with the reigning champion Daza, Hai'le warrior chieftain and supposed "Keybearer." Then, the five challengers began their gruesome training under a giant warrior, a human mage, and a goliath veteran.

On the 1st of Azrus, 576 challengers lined up on the beach with the sole goal of reaching a finish line 100 miles to the west. After a rousing speech by First kaiid of Latreia, Rahed Rannus, the Marooned five set off. In the final stretch, a Nemesis event began, pitting the five challengers against their two companions. Despite that, the seven challengers narrowly escaped the champion Daza, crossing the finish line in unison.

In a special ruling, the winnings were split two ways between the two teams, with the Marooned Five's share being further split to their patron Edina. Having earned the attention of the warrior Daza, the five ex-challengers returned to 200 Tempest Street to celebrate their victory.

On the 2nd of Azrus, before their meeting with Daza, the five challengers met with an old friend of one of the members of the cohort, the crafty pirate captain Leeky Mike. After besting him in a duel, Mike promised the Marooned Five passage out of the city should they need it.

Later that day, following the will of the dragon from their dreams, the Marooned Five finally gained audience with warrior chieftain Daza. After making contact with his flesh, something changed.

On the 2nd of Azrus, the Dragon of Imagination Akhilax took a vessel for the first time in five centuries. With his scheme completed and his followers' usefulness finally depleted, the awakening demigod tried to tie up his loose ends. Narrowly escaping with the help of Cataclysm, the Marooned Five and Medora fled onto Leeky Mike's ship, leaving behind a city shuddering from a fight between demigods.

On the 17th of Azrus, the Marooned Five met with a death priest from the colony of Bayam, and learned of a certain Hidden Order. That same night, they received a mysterious [[Mysterious Letter|letter.]]
