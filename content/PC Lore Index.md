This note acts as an **index** of all my lore for players. Generally speaking, any information you read here is A) **common knowledge** for player characters in my campaigns or B) **easily researchable** by those characters. Players don't necessarily need to "know the loreðŸ¤“," but I encourage at least some minor skimming to enhance your gaming.
