I’ll start by saying that I don’t intend to be a dictator with this, but I’m gonna 1) adopt a “We all respect each other’s time” way of thinking and 2) assume that we’re all trying to play D&D as consistently as possible. This document is to give us clear procedures to make communicating easy. That being said, here’s a general attendance policy:

## How We Communicate

- The line of communication we’ve decided to default to is iMessage.
    
- For ANYTHING in this document, I will clearly, concisely, and promptly communicate it with you over that default line. I simply ask that you try to do the same.
    

## The *Official Schedule*

The *Official Schedule* is the default time we have agreed to play each week. Here’s the breakdown:

### When, Where, How Often, How Long?

- Game sessions will be held on Fridays, from 3:30 to 6:30 PM.
    
- We will hold games using Discord and Foundry.
    
- We will play once a week.
    
- We will play for 3 hours. 
    

### Timing

- Show-up time is 3:20, game-start time is 3:35 PM. I expect you to be in the call at show-up time, take 15 minutes to yap, and be ready and on Foundry by start-time. Regardless of if you’re ready, I will be starting.
    

## What Will Cancel a Session?

- First off, only I (the GM) can cancel a session. If I don’t, you should assume we’re playing that week. And if I’m cancelling, I will make sure you know.
    
- If I have an emergency and become unavailable, then we obviously can’t play that week and I will cancel the session.
    

### Minimum Number of Players (the Quorum)

- The quorum—or minimum number of attending players—I will run a session with is 3. If we have less than that number, I will cancel the game.
    

  
  

## Rescheduling to Save a Cancelled Session

- Again, only I am allowed to move forward with a reschedule if someone proposes it.
    

- To reschedule, I will poll you guys with a definite end time, and if we can reach the quorum for some alternate night, I’ll reschedule the game with an official notice.
    

### One-off Accommodations

- By one-off accommodation, I mean scenarios where you personally request we reschedule, rather than for an emergency.
    

- Ex. Jason’s grandma’s birthday conflicts with the Official Schedule, and he asks me about rescheduling the session that week to the day after instead
    

- If I’m willing to accommodate your request, I will follow the normal rescheduling procedure. However, the consensus from the other players must be unanimous.
    
- If I’m not willing to (or can’t) accommodate your request, then you’ll have to miss that session.
    

  

## Sacrificing Players

- Normally, rescheduling means choosing a new day and time with the highest possible quorum. However, if two quorums are the same (4 and 4), then rescheduling will mean sacrificing one player for another. In that scenario, we will decide who sits out based on the following circumstances:
    

- If the reschedule comes from an emergency cancellation, we will let the two players decide who would rather sit out.
    

-  Ex. If one reschedule date means no Kal-el, and another date means no Jack, then Jack and Kal-el will hash it out amongst themselves
    

- If the sacrifice ever comes from a one-off accommodation, we will default to the Official Schedule when determining who needs to sit out. 
    

- Ex. If rescheduling for Jason’s beloved grandma means that Emerson misses the session, unfortunately Jason (the requestor) will have to sit out. 
    

## Absences & Lateness

- If you know you’re gonna miss a session, you have to let me know as soon as reasonably possible. Doesn’t really matter how far off, either: if you have an event planned three months from now that falls during the Official Schedule, then just let me know and we’ll figure something out in advance.
    

- I’m not gonna have any other special rules for absences. You know by now how missing the game affects me and your fellow players. If you miss a lot of sessions, especially back-to-back ones, then we’ll sit down privately and talk about what to do.
    

- If you know you’ll be late, same thing; I expect a message as long as it's reasonably, humanly possible for you.
    

- If you’re gonna be under 30 minutes late, we’ll collectively decide depending on the circumstances how long we’re willing to wait for you.
    
- If you’re gonna be more than 1.5 hours late, I’ll probably tell you to skip out on the session that week. It’s really hard for me to reasonably incorporate you that deep into the session.
    

  

## Missing Players

- Here’s the procedure for if a player is simply missing; no text, no nothing:
    

- A little before we start the session, I will shoot you a message like “Everything ok?” or “What’s your status?” 
    
- If you confirm an absence, we’ll start normally. If you’re gonna be late, refer to the previous section.
    
- If I get nothing, I’ll wait an extra 15 minutes for a reply, and then start normally if it’s still radio silence.
    

## Permanently Changing the Official Schedule

Finally, for any permanent changes to the Official Schedule, or even a discussion of it, you have to come to me (the GM) first with a private message.

- The procedure here is the same as with one-time accommodations. If we get a unanimous agreement to change the Official Schedule to a new default day and time, then it will change.
    
- Like with the rescheduling rules, if changing the Official Schedule means we absolutely cannot avoid sacrificing another player, then unfortunately me and the requestor will have to discuss them stepping back from the campaign permanently. It blows, but it’s how I’ll be running things.
