**Helixism** is a religious concept that underpins most modern religions across the [[The Meridian|Meridian,]] but especially so for the dominant churches under the [[Helixite Orthodoxy|Helixite Orthodoxy.]] Helixism itself comprises the collective practice of several ethnic groups and nations, but is most prevalent in northern [[Altinin|Altinin]] with its [[Helixite Kingdoms|Helixite Kingdoms.]]  

## Classical Helixism
Classical Helixism is based on the basic belief in the **Helix** and the [[Three Seers|Three Seers.]] The Helix is an ongoing cycle of destruction and rebirth—as foreseen by the Seers—where each spoke on the Helix represents a turning of the [[Ages|Age.]] At the midpoints of each band in the Helix are [[Calamity|Calamities]] that threaten to destroy it forever. As each new Calamity approaches, the Three Seers guide humanity to prevent it, before vanishing until the next Calamity. Thus, the Helix is built upwards toward salvation.

Here, the Seers were seen more as warrior figures, and Calamities are personified as rivals for them to defeat in righteous battle. The Seers were seen as the leaders and strategists of grand wars against the forces of Calamity.

Classical Helixism was most popular during the [[Age of Gold|Age of Gold,]] but has since been overshadowed by modernized structures that include the current pantheon.

## Modern Helixism
Modern Helixism is still rooted in the basis of the Helix and Seers, but has now widened into multiple [[Helixite Orthodoxy|Helixite orthodox churches,]] each with their own [[Pantheon|deities.]] These modern Churches have varying interpretations of Helixism, but maintain a belief in the Seers and cycle of Calamity.
