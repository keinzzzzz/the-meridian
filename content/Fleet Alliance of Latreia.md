The **Fleet Alliance of Latreia**, known colloquially as **Latreia** or the Fleet Alliance, is a coalition of autonomous states in northeastern [[Altinin|Altinin]] known for their shared navy, which they use to dominate trade throughout the Dragon Strait and Claw Bays. People from Latreia are known as *Latreians.*

Latreia is governed by the twelve [[Kaiids of Latreia|kaiids]], regional leaders that meet as a single governing body in [[Grandport]] to pass legislation for the greater coalition. Each Kaiid is a leader of a city or region in Latreian territory, which also includes a handful of islands in the Entrati region.
