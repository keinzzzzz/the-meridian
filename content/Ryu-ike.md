**Ryu-Ike** is known as the Green Continent, for the very air is lush with the energy of life. The entire continent, unbroken in its enormity, is covered in a dense pelt of forest and jungle. Trees of sizes varying from that of shrubs to that of entire cities coat the landscape, with leaves of a thousand colors reaching up toward the cool blue sky. There are Fusion Forests, named Fushirin by the locals, alien forests of mutated and hyperevolved plants. For example, take Flash Jungles, which exist in a volatile bubble of equatorial climate. These jungles grow as high as fifty stories tall in mere weeks and then burn to the ground in a blaze, where they are born anew from the ash. Powerful and ancient flora and fauna live in every corner of this place, and the people have come to respect their presence as a collective. And thus, the thousands of mismatched peoples born of the Great Fusion live in a relative peacetime. Ryu-ike is the heart of the Meridian, where the land is rich and the culture richer.

Ryu-ike is home to five powerful dynasties who have ruled over five empires: Uyeda, Liang, Kaiho, Shou, and Nishi. These dynasties and their empires were not always united, however; during the [[Thousand Days' War]], the continent was divided among three empires and multiple smaller nations. The main three empires, Felsac Empire, Uyeda Empire, and Liang Empire, were locked in constant battle over land to feed their millions. The Felsac Empire, first to face the human onslaught, toted the world’s greatest army, yet was swiftly pushed back. In a desperate alliance with the other empires, the most fledgling version of Ryu Empire was thus formed to save the continent. Being the only nation to successfully repel the human onslaught and claiming the first land victory against humanity, this alliance made quite the name for themselves. At that time, the alliance’s power was split between three emperors, nicknamed the Great Emperors for their prowess in battle: Golden Empress Vara Vicellius of Liang, Red Emperor Tiliak Graumai of Felsac, and Dread Emperor Aiguo Ren of Uyeda. After the Thousand Days War and the dissolution of the Pantheon Alliance, the emperors merged into a single entity named Ryu Empire.

Historically, the Ryu Empire was lead by a single shogun and royal empress atop the Onyx Throne. While possessing some military power as the hand of the empress, the shogun was mostly a public figure; the empire was run by the empress. The shogun was to carry out her decrees, oversee the bureaucracy, and determine what messages were worthy of reaching her ears. Both figures were members of the powerful Ryu bloodline; a family believed to possess blood of the creator races. The Ryu dynasty was immensely complicated and wrought with frequent internal struggles of race; elven, orcish, aaracokra, goblinoid, and reptilian members frequently participated in inbreeding and political assassinations. In an attempt to curb this strife, the empress ascended the throne in a cycle by race: an orcish empress would be followed by a goblinoid empress, then an aaracokra empress, etc.

However, internal conflict continued, and in the year 1219, the empress issued the Edict of the Ancients, a royal decree and revelation from the Mother Tree that would transition the Ryu Empire to the Federal Shogunate of Ryu-ike—one run by the shogun, advised by the empress, and split into five equally powerful states. This structure was reminiscent of an ancient empire of the Dark Age, where each dynasty belonged to a single creator race, and was meant to allow autonomy to the five main dynasties of Ryu while checking each others’ power.

The Federal Shogunate of Ryu-ike was split according to each race’s descendants: the historic land of the Giants, Nishi, was lent to the orcs; the land of the aearee, Liang, to the aaracokra and avians; the land of sarrukh, Shou, to the lizardfolk and reptilians; the land of the fey, Uyeda, to the elves. The goblinoids, a previous slave race that only gained political power late in the third Age, were highly disliked, and thus were “granted” a barren wasteland to the far south that limited their political influence: the historic land of the demons, Kaiho.

As the health of the most recent reptilian empress waned, the goblinoids appointed their successor, a young goblin descendant of the Ryu dynasty. The federal shogunate, in an event that is now cited as the beginning of the end of the Federal Shogunate of Ryu-ike, denied the goblinoids their request, believing them a lesser race, and cast their representatives out of the capital. This "holy" event, named the Edict of Demons, led to the Long Walk, where thousands of goblinoids marched from their homes to the land of demons. In the wastes of Kaiho, political dissatisfaction turned to civil unrest, civil unrest turned to public protest, and public protest turned to national uprising. In the year 1592, after almost 300 years of roiling peace, the orcish empress was assassinated, throwing the shogunate into chaos. The new nation of Kaiho and empire of Nishi officially split off from Ryu, and in light of the federal shogunate’s disturbance of a perceived religious decree, the neighboring Uyeda, Liang, and Shou Empires soon followed.

Now, in the year 1598, following the dissolution of the Federal Shogunate of Ryu-ike, the five empires are fighting a political battle for the Onyx Throne, left vacant after the death of their empress. Many believe a rightful goblin empress must ascend the throne to complete the divine cycle and restore peace, but outside forces are raising tensions even further: Uyeda Empire is currently under attack from the West by Avalan, and Nishi is in a state of civil war between goblin sympathizers and non-sympathizers. Kaiho vies for better land, engaging in hit-and-run skirmishes with Nishi and establishing goblin camps across the continent.
