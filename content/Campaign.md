## Tone

The mood of your campaign. How does it FEEL to play in this campaign

- I want my campaign to feel adventurous and somewhat lighthearted, but with dark moments (cosmic horrors❤) and emotional moments littered throughout to keep it feeling grounded (a vibe like Avatar TLA). I also want to inspire a sense of scale and grandness; I want my players to get the feeling their characters are small—but significant—actors on a humongous stage.
    
- Maybe the tone will shift from adventurous—>serious as the campaign goes on and the stakes rise (Fullmetal Alchemist does this).
    

## Concept

- This story follows a party of adventurers who are trying to stop an ancient evil order from using the Splitlock for their own goals.

## Setting

- This story takes place on the Meridian, a shattered region where humans are not the dominant species. Instead, humankind makes up the slave class in most societies and are almost universally despised. This is because of a great war waged by humankind to conquer the planet, all in an attempt to unlock the divine artifact named the Splitlock. With the Splitlock sealed and the human population pruned to acceptable levels, a tense Age of Peace has held for almost 600 years. Today, in the year 598, the land boils with tension: fears of fresh conflict between world superpowers, the orthodox churches, and ancient orders brew among the common people.

## Conflict

- An ancient continental order has stolen the Splitlock from its protectors, but they can't activate it without its keys, which have long been destroyed. The order has found a way to reverse-engineer these keys, but this mysterious process will take time. If they succeed, they will be able to freely reshape the world in their image, ushering in a new Age.
