The **Thousand Days' War,** also known as the **[[Calamity]] War,** the **Great War,** or just the **War,** was a three-year conflict that marked the end of the **[[Timeline of Atlaax|Age]] of War** and the beginning of the **Present Age.**

The conflict began with the landing of humankind on [[Ryu-ike]] and [[Altinin]] and their subsequent conquest across the [[The Meridian|Meridian.]]

Humans, who were collected primarily on the [[Riwera|western continent]] where they dominated, suddenly declared war on the world, beginning a conquest across the Meridian. Given their unique ability to adapt, by this point in time mankind had developed technology reminiscent of that of their [[Earth|origin planet.]]

On Ryu-Ike, famously the human assault was first halted at Lifeblood Basin, where the three emperors—Red Emperor Graumai, Golden Empress Vicellius, and Dread Emperor Ren—won the first battle against humanity.

The Thousand Days War ended with the formation of the Pantheon Coalition and subsequent sealing of the [[The Splitlock]] and scattering of its keys. Following the war, human-occupied territory was split among the Pantheon War Council.
