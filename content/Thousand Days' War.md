The **Thousand Days' War,** also known as the [[Calamity]] War, the Great War, or just "the War," was a three-year conflict between the [[Pantheon Coalition]] and forces of [[Humans|humankind]] that marked the end of the [[Age of War]] and the beginning of the current [[Age of Peace|Age of Peace.]]

The conflict began suddenly on the ninth of Mayra, 1761 with the landing of the forces of humankind on [[Ryu-ike]] and [[Altinin]] from the [[Shroud|Shroud,]] which marked the beginning of their conquest across the [[The Meridian|Meridian.]]

This period of the conflict can be characterized by terror, death, and destruction. Humanity's use of technologically and magically advanced war machines, explosive devices, and advanced automata caused the shocked forces of both continents to be routed repeatedly. Modern scholars have surmised that these technological marvels may have been reverse-engineered from technology from the [[Earth|human primeworld.]]

On Janus 5th, 1763, those who remained on the northern and southern continents met to address the global threat. Knowing their demise was certain without some form of global allegiance, the [[Pantheon Coalition]] was officially established, with the day now being celebrated as **Coalition Day.**

The Thousand Days War ended on Febra 1st, 1764 with the forging of the [[Pact of the Pantheon|Pact of the Pantheon,]] sealing of the [[Splitlock|Splitlock,]] and subsequent annihilation of its keys. Following the war, human-occupied territory was split among the Pantheon Coalition's war council.
