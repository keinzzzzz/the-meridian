The **Pantheon Coalition,** or just "the Coalition," was the alliance of nations across the [[The Meridian|Meridian]] that opposed the forces of humanity during the [[Thousand Days' War|Thousand Days' War]] according to the will of the [[Three Seers|Three Seers.]] 

The Pantheon Coalition, while hailed for the global unity it established during the War, is best known for its military. Many enthusiasts consider the Coalition Army to be the single greatest fighting force of the [[Ages|Ages]]â€”certainly not an incorrect claim, given their collective accolades.

Military strategists estimate that by the second year of the war, roughly 44% of mainland [[Altinin]] and at least 50% of mainland [[Ryu-Ike]] had been claimed by the forces of [[Humans|mankind.]] A year later, almost zero percent of Coalition land was controlled by humans.

Near-globally on the fifth of Janus, participant countries celebrate **Coalition Day,** an international holiday that honors the fallen and drinks to the peacetimes they created. 

Following the sealing of the [[Splitlock|Splitlock,]] the Coalition was dissolved, but participant states swore upon the [[Pact of the Pantheon|Pact of the Pantheon.]]
