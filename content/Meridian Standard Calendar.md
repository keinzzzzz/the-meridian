The **Meridian Standard Calendar**  in the [[Age of Peace|Age of Peace,]] also known as the International Standard Calendar, includes thirteen months of exactly 28 days each, with one leap day belonging to no month at the end of the year for a total of 365 days. 

This current calendar is a modernized version of the [[Humanocentrism|humanocentric]] calendar of the [[Age of Gold|Age of Gold,]] which was originally derived from the [[Earth|human primeworld]] and had twelve months of varying length. In favor of a simpler alternative, the [[Pact of the Pantheon]] dictated that all nations participant in the [[Thousand Days' War]] switch to the Meridian Standard following the turning of the [[Ages|Age.]] 

In the year 599 A.C., most of the world has adopted the calendar for its consistency and popularity.
