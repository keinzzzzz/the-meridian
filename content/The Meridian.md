The **Meridian** is a region of habitable land that extends from pole to pole on the planet [[Atlaaxian System|Atlaax.]] The Meridian, geographically, is roughly 4,000 miles wide and 9,500 miles tall, and consists of two continents and [[Six Seas|six seas]].

The continent to the northwest, [[Altinin]] (or simply the Northern Continent), is a shattered continent of high mountains, rolling hills, desert valleys, tropics, mesas, taigas, and glacial plains. The continent to the southeast, [[Ryu-ike]] (or simply the Southern Continent), is a lush continent of towering forests, plains, steppes, jungles, savannahs, rainforests, badlands, and volcanic deserts. To the east and west of the Meridian is a thick wall of swirling [[Shroud|magical darkness]] that prevents lateral travel.

The Meridian is a place of incredibly rich history spanning several thousand years, split into [[Timeline of Atlaax|Ages]] whose ends caused some form of global chaos, known as [[Calamity|Calamities.]] The land itself can be characterized by this rich history of destruction, particularly the [[Great Fusion|first Calamity:]] humble farmsteads might subside around the crumbling ruins of an old-Age city; fishing villages may sit in the skeletal maw of some long-extinct colossus; societies may be structured using academic foundations stolen from ancient scholars. 

Beyond major settlements, the Meridian is a chaotic land of both incredible beauty and terrible danger. Travelers consider the viscera of forgotten technologies, the corpses of empires, and the battlegrounds of gods common landmarks. All sorts of vagabonds, scavengers, and adventurers can be found wandering the shattered countryside in search of the Ages' many undiscovered rewards. 

Yet, these riches are not without their obstacles. The wounds of old conflicts and past Calamities still mar the land and sea, infusing them with terrors of all kinds. While one region may be habitable, the next may be swarming with creatures mutated by some ancient magical failure. An amateur would quickly discover that even the land itself can be an enemy; entire biomes have become victims of arcane infestation or long-forgotten wars. Experts of the Meridian's chaotic nature would likely agree that routes outside the beaten path may be unpopular for good reason.
